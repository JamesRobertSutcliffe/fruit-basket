# fruit-basket

To do:

HTML / CSS

Create basket for remaining fruit / add visibility class
Initially set to basket is empty - return to this when basket is cleared

JS

Complete logic for adding and minusing price of products - apple complete / copy this for other fruit
toggle visibility on for each basket only when product is in basket / otherwise show empty basket message
ensure all totals are correct / total price at bottow / when individual items are removed this should be reflected in total price
