## Fruit Basket

## Description

The fruit basket is a JS driven mobile-friendly e-commerce front-end project implemented via HTML, Bootstrap and css. I used a combination of HTML attributes, CSS/Bootstrap styling and javascript features to add interactivity via js DOM.

My main motivation for creating the fruit basket was to have a project allowing me to combine all of my HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript skills. I wanted to build a project that would allow me to practice and develop all of these skills as well as showcase them in clear and simple environment, creating an e-commerce web application with js driven features allowed me to do whilst creating an application that mirrors a feaure that has a real world use case. 

In building this project I developed and polished my front-end web skills, tying together HTML, CSS and javascript to create a functioning website, implementing functions for interactivity and objects to store date.
